# Customer-Churn-Prediction
The problem is to predict whether a customer will churn from a company. The dataset is the Telecom Customers Dataset and it is a private dataset, which contains over 11,000 rows and 20 columns. The dataset includes information about the customer's demographics, usage patterns, and billing history.
The ML method used is logistic regression. Logistic regression is a statistical method that predicts the probability of a binary outcome. In this case, the binary outcome is whether or not a customer will churn.
The code is written in Python and uses the scikit-learn library.
